# KNEC KCSE School Results Checker
A python automation script that uses the school code of a school to brute force the KNEC servers to yield the grades of everyone in the whole school

## V1
The school code is hard coded alongside the range of index numbers needed.

## Schools available
- OUR LADY OF MT.CARMEL MARYHILL GIRLS HIGH SCHOOL
- ST.CLARE GIRLS' SECONDARY-ELBURGON
- MOI GIRLS' SCHOOL NAIROBI
- THE KENYA HIGH SCHOOL
- NAIROBI SCHOOL
- LENANA SCHOOL
- KAREN ' C ' SECONDARY   SCHOOL
- MOI GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL- ELDORET

## Dependencies
Esnure you have Python installed. I used Python 3.11.5 for on the machine I executed the code on.

```
Python 3.11.5
```

Install selenium

```
pip install selenium
```

By default selenium obtains the webdriver needed provided you have version 4.6 and later.

I have not verified if the code is backwards or forwards compatible with Python versions. Similarly, I do not guarantee that it will work on any machine except for one running Windows 11. I am open to contributions and bug fixes for different Operating systems

## Feature Requests
- Asynchronous handling
- Conversion to .xlsx rather than .txt upon completion for Data Analysis
- Support for MacOS
- Support for Linux
- Support for Windows 10
- Support for Chrome
- Support for Edge
- Migration to Mojo to minimise overhead and utilisation of the GPU instead of the CPU
