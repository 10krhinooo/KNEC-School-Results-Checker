# KNEC KCSE School Results Checker

## Dependencies
Esnure you have Python installed. I used Python 3.11.5 for on the machine I executed the code on.

```
Python 3.11.5
```

Install selenium

```
pip install selenium
```

By default selenium obtains the webdriver needed provided you have version 4.6 and later.

## Feature Requests
- Asynchronous handling
- Conversion to .xlsx rather than .txt upon completion for Data Analysis
- Support for MacOS
- Support for Windows 10
- Support for Chrome
- Support for Edge
- Migration to Mojo to minimise overhead and utilisation of the GPU instead of the CPU

## All Hardware Configurations That Have Run It

The machine below ran very hot and could only execute only one instance efficiently.

```
Processor	12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1250U   1.10 GHz
Installed RAM	16.0 GB (15.7 GB usable)
Opearating System Windows 11 Home (23H2)
Graphics card Intel(R) Iris(R) Xe Graphics
Storage SK Hynix BC& HM512GDÂ£JX013N 512 GB
Python Version 3.11.5
```

The machine below ran really well. RAM was well economised. There was asynchronous handling of the requests when the script was ran in two instances on the same machine.

```
